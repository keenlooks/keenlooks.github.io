Hello! I am currently working as part of [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)'s Frontier [Red](https://red.anthropic.com/) Team, where I focus on evaluating large language models' (LLMs') cyber capabilities ([example](https://red.anthropic.com/2025/cyber-toolkits/)) to help ensure their safe and robust development.

Before joining Anthropic, I completed my PhD at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/) studying under my advisor, [Lujo Bauer](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~lbauer/), in [CyLab](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/). At CMU, my projects involved [machine learning for malware detection](/publications/2021-06-07-malware-makeover-breaking-ml-based-static-analysis-by-modifying-executable-bytes), [cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning](/publications/2022-05-11-anyplay-an-intrinsic-augmentation-for-zero-shot-coordination), [robust machine learning](/publications/2023-08-09-adversarial-training-for-raw-binary-malware-classifiers.md), and machine learning based anomaly detection. I usually incorporate my [interest](https://keanelucas.com/projects/doom-bot) in reinforcement learning into my research whenever I get the chance!

Originally from the [Matanuska Valley](https://www.frontiersman.com/news/trio-of-valley-students-graduate-together-from-u-s-air-force-academy/article_e0b6e5de-edad-11e3-98fc-001a4bcf887a.html) in Alaska, I [graduated](https://youtu.be/tCckScbNfq8?t=88) from the [United States Air Force Academy](https://www.usafa.edu/) (class of 2014) with a BS in Computer Science and from Carnegie Mellon University, [Information Networking Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/) with an MS in [Information Security](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/academics/msis/index.html). After gaining [valuable](https://www.dvidshub.net/video/330646/usafa-team-competes-nsa-cyberdefense-exercise) [experience](https://www.wired.com/story/national-guards-fire-mapping-drones-get-ai-upgrade/) serving in [unique](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) [roles](https://www.ai.mil/) in the Air Force, I separated as a Captain (O3) to pursue a PhD supported by the [NDSEG Fellowship](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/).

My current focus is on advancing the safe and responsible development of advanced AI systems, particularly in eliciting, evaluating, and projecting LLM's cybersecurity capabilities.
