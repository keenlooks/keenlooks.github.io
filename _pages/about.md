Hello! I am a second year PhD student working in [Cylab](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/). With my advisor, [Lujo Bauer](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~lbauer/), I study robust machine learning, applications of machine learning for malware detection, and machine learning based anomaly detection. I also incorporate my [interest](https://keanelucas.com/projects/doom-bot) in reinforcement learning into my research whenever I get the chance!

Originally from the [Matanuska Valley](https://www.frontiersman.com/news/trio-of-valley-students-graduate-together-from-u-s-air-force-academy/article_e0b6e5de-edad-11e3-98fc-001a4bcf887a.html) in Alaska, I [graduated](https://youtu.be/tCckScbNfq8?t=88) from the [United States Air Force Academy](https://www.usafa.edu/) (class of 2014) with a BS in Computer Science and from Carnegie Mellon University, [Information Networking Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/) with an MS in [Information Security](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/academics/msis/index.html). After gaining [valuable](https://www.dvidshub.net/video/330646/usafa-team-competes-nsa-cyberdefense-exercise) [experience](https://www.wired.com/story/national-guards-fire-mapping-drones-get-ai-upgrade/) serving in [unique](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) [roles](https://www.ai.mil/) in the Air Force, I separated as a Captain (O3) to pursue a PhD supported by the [NDSEG Fellowship](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/).

My overall goal is to advance in the field of machine learning by continuing to learn the skills and expertise to become a reliable researcher focused on positive societal impact via effective work in industry and government.
