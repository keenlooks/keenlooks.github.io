Hello! I am part of [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)'s Frontier [Red](https://red.anthropic.com/) Team, where I [evaluate](https://red.anthropic.com/2025/cyber-toolkits/), [improve](https://red.anthropic.com/2025/ai-for-cyber-defenders/), and [talk about](/talks/2025-08-09-claude-climbing-a-ctf-scoreboard-near-you) large language models' (LLMs') cyber capabilities to help ensure their safe and robust development.

Before joining Anthropic, I completed my PhD at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/) studying under [Lujo Bauer](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~lbauer/) in [CyLab](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/). My projects involved [machine learning for malware detection](/publications/2021-06-07-malware-makeover-breaking-ml-based-static-analysis-by-modifying-executable-bytes), [cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning](/publications/2022-05-11-anyplay-an-intrinsic-augmentation-for-zero-shot-coordination), and [robust machine learning](/publications/2023-08-09-adversarial-training-for-raw-binary-malware-classifiers.md).

Originally from the [Matanuska Valley](https://www.frontiersman.com/news/trio-of-valley-students-graduate-together-from-u-s-air-force-academy/article_e0b6e5de-edad-11e3-98fc-001a4bcf887a.html) in Alaska, I [graduated](https://youtu.be/tCckScbNfq8?t=88) from the [US Air Force Academy](https://www.usafa.edu/) with a BS in Computer Science and from CMU [INI](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/) with an MS in [Information Security](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/academics/msis/index.html). After [serving](https://www.dvidshub.net/video/330646/usafa-team-competes-nsa-cyberdefense-exercise) in [several](https://www.wired.com/story/national-guards-fire-mapping-drones-get-ai-upgrade/) [unique](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) [roles](https://www.ai.mil/) in the Air Force, I separated as a Captain (O3) to pursue a PhD as an [NDSEG Fellow](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/).


## Research & Writing

My most recent contributions are on [Anthropic's Frontier Red Team blog](https://red.anthropic.com/), where we regularly post about our work measuring, projecting, and improving frontier LLM capabilities:

- **[AI for Cyber Defenders](https://red.anthropic.com/2025/ai-for-cyber-defenders/)** - Building defensive cybersecurity capabilities
- **[Claude in Cyber Competitions](https://red.anthropic.com/2025/cyber-competitions/)** - Evaluating Claude's performance in CTF competitions (the subject of my [DEF CON talk](/talks/2025-08-09-claude-climbing-a-ctf-scoreboard-near-you))
- **[Cyber Toolkits](https://red.anthropic.com/2025/cyber-toolkits/)** - An awesome collaboration with [Brian Singer](https://www.brianhacks.com/) on [measuring LLMs' network attack capabilities](https://engineering.cmu.edu/news-events/news/2025/07/24-when-llms-autonomously-attack.html).
