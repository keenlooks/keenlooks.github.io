Hello! I am a second year PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). With my advisor, Lujo Bauer, I study robust machine learning, applications of machine learning for malware detection, and machine learning based anomaly detection. I also incorporate my deep interest in reinforcement learning into my research whenever it is appropriate. 

Previously, I graduated from the United States Air Force Academy (class of 2014) with a BS in Computer Science and from Carnegie Mellon University with an MS in Information Security. After serving in the Air Force in several research roles, I separated as a Captain (O3) to pursue a PhD.

My overall goal is to continue learning the skills and expertise to become a machine learning researcher focused on positive societal impact in industry and government.
