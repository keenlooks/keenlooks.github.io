* B.S. in Computer Science, United States Air Force Academy, 2014
* M.S. in Information Security, Carnegie Mellon University, 2016
* (in progress) Ph.D in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University

Highlighted Experience
======
* Deep Learning Researcher at Department of Defense (DoD) Research Directorate (RD)
  * Spring 2017 to Fall 2019
  * Customizes dense neural nets, recurrent neural nets, generative adversarial networks, and reinforcement learning networks to aid in solving Intelligence Community (IC) problems. Attended NeurIPS and other AI related conferences.
  * Author on technical paper in final stages. The work has been presented at internal conferences and is being pushed into production as a pathfinding use case to justify deep learning analytics.

* Machine Learning Researcher at Center for Communications Research La Jolla
  * Summer 2018
  * Co-wrote 2 technical papers submitted for publication. Executed 100+ hours of experimentation with top university mathematicians to solve NSA’s hardest problems. Implemented experimental ML process derived from research

* Technical Project Lead at DoD Joint Artificial Intelligence Center
  * Fall 2018 to Spring 2019
  * Focused on applying ML algorithms for the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief National Mission Initiative. This is a particularly demanding job that requires constant mission justification to external non-technical organizations and rapid objective pivoting in a highly uncertain environment.
